At the same level as this notebook on github, there is an Exercise folder that contains carprices.csv. This file has car sell prices for 3 different models. First plot data points on a scatter plot chart to see if linear regression model can be applied. If yes, then build a model that can answer following questions,

1) Predict price of a mercedez benz that is 4 yr old with mileage 45000

2) Predict price of a BMW X5 that is 7 yr old with mileage 86000

3) Tell me the score (accuracy) of your model. (Hint: use LinearRegression().score())
